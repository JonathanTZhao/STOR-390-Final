# STOR-390-Final

This repository hosts the files for the STOR 390 final project.

These include: A link to the dataset used for the replicated model, a RMD file with the replicated model, a RMD, HTML, and pdf file of the final paper, and this readme file.

The reason why a link is provided for the dataset used is because the size of the dataset is too big to store on GitHub. Even when compressed into a zip file, it is still over 500MB. Here is an additional link to the dataset: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2/about_data

This paper examines the research paper "Crime Prediction For Better Response Using KNN, PCA, And Random Forest" by Uchenna Akujuobi. It introduces the methods and purposes of the research, recreates a model, analyzes its methodologies and flaws, addresses the normative concerns on predictive policing, and concludes with an outlook for the future.
